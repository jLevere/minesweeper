Mine sweeper is a project I am making while learning java.  

The goal is to generate and print a text matrix that can be pasted into a discord chat to play minesweeper using spoiler tags to cover the tiles.

known issues / things I am working on
    /* NOTES
    Needs better input validation for things like (8, \n)  and stuff like that

    the number of booms isnt always right
      - at first it was because I had less than or equal to in the while loop
      - now it is because it doesnt check to see if an entry is already a mine and sometimes just overwrites them

Mine sweeper is a project I created while first learning java.  

The goal was to generate and print a text matrix that could be pasted into a discord chat to play minesweeper using spoiler tags to cover the tiles.

Known issues:

  - The number of booms isnt always right. It doesnt check to see if an entry is already a mine and sometimes just overwrites them
  - Change the tile asignment loops to go from left to right insted of top to bottom for readablity
